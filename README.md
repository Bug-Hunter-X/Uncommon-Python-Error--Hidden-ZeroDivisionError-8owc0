# Uncommon Python Error: Hidden ZeroDivisionError

This repository showcases a simple Python function that demonstrates an uncommon scenario for encountering a `ZeroDivisionError`. While `ZeroDivisionError` is a common exception, its manifestation can sometimes be subtle and challenging to debug in larger codebases.

The `bug.py` file contains the faulty code. The solution is provided in `bugSolution.py`.

This example highlights the importance of comprehensive error handling and careful consideration of edge cases when writing robust Python applications.
